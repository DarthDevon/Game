# RoboKiller

A simple wave-based FPS prototype built with Babylon.js. Click **Play** to start fighting off incoming robots. The player begins with a pistol and limited ammo. Each wave increases the enemy count and difficulty.

### Controls
- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look / Aim
- **Left Click** - Shoot
- **R** - Reload
- **E** - Pick up nearby ammo or health packs

### Gameplay
- Procedurally spawns a small multi-floor arena when the game starts.
- Waves of enemies attack; after wave two flying drones may appear.
- Health and ammo boxes randomly spawn at set points each wave.
- Survive as long as possible; when health reaches zero the game ends.

This repository contains only a prototype demonstrating the basic systems described in the development plan.
